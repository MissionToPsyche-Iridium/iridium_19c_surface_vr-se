## Overview
The NASA Psyche Mission: Surface Data VR application provides an interactive and educational Virtual Reality (VR) experience, allowing users to explore Mars using real NASA data. Users can stand on Mars' surface, navigate its terrain, and learn key facts about Mars and the Psyche asteroid. The application also features a quiz game to test users' knowledge of Psyche Mission.

The application is a result of the Psyche Student Collaborations component of NASA’s Psyche Mission (https://psyche.asu.edu) and is created in partial fulfillment of Arizona State University Capstone Courses.
