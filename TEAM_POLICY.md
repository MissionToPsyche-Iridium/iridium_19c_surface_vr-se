# Team Work Policy: Communication and Consistency

## Introduction  
Our success as a team depends on consistent work and clear communication. To ensure the success of our project, this policy outlines the standards for work consistency and communication.

## 1. Effective Communication
- **Responsiveness**: It is essential to reply to messages and inquiries promptly. Because of our challenge in schedule conflicts, we should at least leave a few messages per week for updates on the project and any changes made.
- **Transparency**: To keep everyone informed, the team should be notified as soon as there are any obstacles, hold-ups, or updates.
- **Collaboration**: To keep the team together and avoid misunderstandings, regular meetings and open lines of communication are essential. At the very least one meeting per week for all team members.
## 2. Work Consistency
- **Reliability**: Tasks must be finished timely(or ideally, a little sooner to lessen the workload) and to the best of each team member's abilities. To manage expectations, challenges should be communicated as soon as they occur.
- **Quality**: It is the responsibility of each team member to deliver work that satisfies established criteria and enhances the project's overall quality.
- **Accountability**: It is expected of team members to keep track of their progress and hold themselves responsible for proceeding to make regular contributions to the project.

## Conclusion  
We make sure that our team stays productive, cohesive, and capable of accomplishing our shared objectives by following these policies.
